Past work has demonstrated that cognitive flexibility is influenced by trial-to-trial transitions in reward. Increased reward favors stability while static reward favors flexibility. Given the large variability in the magnitude of these effects, it is important to understand the factors underlying this variability. We examined the effects of gender and behavioral inhibition/approach motivation (BIS-BAS) during task switching under different reward transitions. Compared to males, female subjects showed greater flexibility, and were less influenced by reward. Opposing effects of BIS and BAS were found, with low (high) levels of BAS (BIS) showing an effect of reward tranisition on flexibility and high (low) levels of BAS (BIS) showing only an effect of previous reward. These findings have implications for how hypothesizing about how reward-guided flexibility is impacted in psychopathologies that affect motivational processes.
